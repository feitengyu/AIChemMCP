  步骤 1: {'method': '物料站', 'params': {'description': 'Gather Rhodamine B and all necessary chemical reagents and solvents for preparing the sample solutions.'}}
  步骤 2: {'method': '置物工作站', 'params': {'description': 'Store the gathered materials properly until they are ready for use.'}}
  步骤 3: {'method': '液站工作站', 'params': {'description': 'Prepare a series of Rhodamine B solutions with known concentrations. This involves accurately measuring Rhodamine B and dissolving it in a suitable solvent to achieve desired concentrations.'}}
  步骤 4: {'method': '磁力搅拌工作站', 'params': {'description': 'Ensure the Rhodamine B solutions are homogeneously mixed to prepare them for absorption measurement.'}}
  步骤 5: {'method': '紫外光谱工作站', 'params': {'description': 'Measure the absorbance of each Rhodamine B solution at its maximum absorption wavelength using a UV-visible spectrophotometer. Ensure that the path length is known.'}}
  步骤 6: {'method': 'data_analysis', 'params': {'description': 'Using the measured absorbance, calculate the molar extinction coefficient for Rhodamine B by plotting absorbance vs. concentration and determining the slope of the linear fit, which corresponds to the molar extinction coefficient.'}}
